# CheatLib
This lib allows you to get the game handle, write in memory, read the memory, allocate new memory, start a remote thread and close it. <br>
I created a poc to call the print console func in Assault Cube game. <br>
The poc uses the lib and it's functions so you can see a whole example of how I did this in the PoC folder. <br>
This library is usefull if you want to create your own cheats in solo player for example. <br>
<b>Don't use this project if you want to cheat in multiplayer there is any AC bypass.</b> <br>

Enjoy :)
